We kindly ask that you use your full name in the Zoom session and coffee meeting.

To join the coffee break you will need to use Firefox or Chrome (except on iPad/iPhone, where you have to use Safari and consequently will experience problems).

If you use separate devices for Zoom and coffee, please use headphones **for Zoom** to prevent echo. If this is not possible please leave the Zoom meeting while attending the coffee break.
